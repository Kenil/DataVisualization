                excellent performance for many athlete. However, modern day athletes have one more tool in their bag to
                gain a competitive edge over their opponents, data. Sport produces vast amount of data and it mind as
                well be a garbage if not visualized properly. Thankfully, technology today has the ability to scrutinize
                every part of that data. It does not whether it is a team sport or an individual sport, they all produce
                data which can be studied to improve the outcome of future competitions. Athletes use it to perform
                better and organizations use it to recruit best candidate to their organization, as it is portrayed in
                movie Moneyball.  </p>

            <p class="lead" align="justify">As a passionate sport fan and technology enthusiast, I enjoyed this project a lot. The
                motivation for this project was to visualize a given tennis data in a structured manor that would engage
                the user while directly interacting with the application. For this project, I have used data
                visualization tool called d3. d3, stands for Data-Driven Document, is a Javascript library that provides
                wide range of interactive data visualization techniques. In my first assignment, I had performed a c
                omparative study between two data related to Australian Open tennis match, accuracy and speed. For that
                purpose of the study, I had defined accuracy as the percentage of first serves that landed in service
                area in the first attempt only. Definition of accuracy is a vague concept in tennis as one can define it
                in many ways. To remove that ambiguity I added two more element to that definition, number of aces and
                number of errors. Player who is accurate will have higher number of aces and least number of errors. </p>

            <p class="lead" align="justify">Tennis is a hierarchical sport, where two players compete to advance to next round. And best
                way to visualize this hierarchical nature is by tree layout. Month of March is upon us and all
                collegiate student know that it is time to create brackets. As you can see in the image it is very
                similar to tree in nature, where winning player is the parent node while its children are parent node
                itself and opposing player node. Thus, I initially used d3’s collapsible tree layout to create a bracket
                like structure, which I successfully implemented (bracket_Layout.js file included in project folder).
                But I scraped that implementation due to an angular nature of the plot which did not look good visually.
                <br><br> My main goal was to create an interactive visualization that was easy to understand and use.
                Improper data visualization is one of the major reason why people have different representation of same
                data. To achieve this simple but complicated design, I created a following HTML layout. There is menu
                bar with a drop down menu to select a year, four additional button in the body and large d3 canvas to
                draw a tree. Four buttons are linked to three different attribute from the data and one to deselect the
                selected attribute. Accuracy data is designated a green button, as it is a positive aspect of the data.
                Aces are associated with speed and accuracy both, hence the orange button. Lastly, red button is linked
                to error attribute as it is a negative aspect of the game. This color are seamlessly reflected on to
                tree structure when user interacts with them.  </p>

            <p class="lead" align="justify">d3 canvas can be zoomed and panned, which allows the user to focus on one part of the data
                if desired. For interaction, user can select a year from drop down menu which will draw display node I
                referred to as a champion node. Hovering is another interaction available for user. Hovering over
                champion node will show a small profile of the player, while hovering over any other node will show a
                statistics of the match. Two children node are displayed upon clicking on parent node. This two nodes
                represent the previous round match that parent node won in order to reach the next round. In other
                words, if parent node was in final round, then its children are in semi-final round. All this
                information are showed to user when the mouse over a particular node. <br><br> An algorithm computes the
                thickness of the link between nodes and changes its color to highlight the selected attribute. Actual
                value of the attribute is also shown for faster analysis of the data. Too many graphs and charts or
                animations tend to divert the users attention. I have developed a visualization that engages user to
                interact without losing their attention.
